# gpt-assistants

Ideas for assistants to help me out:
1. Review my notes, consolidating and asking follow-up questions, format for my review, and email it to me.
2. Every day, do a quick search for events near me, filtering for my purposes. If necessary, reach out to inquire about a meeting.

Capabilities involved:
1. Organize a larger-than-prompt knowledge-base [1]
2. Sending emails (easy) [1,2]
3. Determining which emails should be routed to which assistant (little harder) [2]
4. Search the internet (done) [2]
